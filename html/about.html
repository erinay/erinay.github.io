    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! My name is Erina and I am an Aerospace Engineering student at MIT. 
            I am set to graduate in 2023. My interests are in the interdisciplinary nature of
            woring with controls and automation of new technologies, especially related to aerial
            and space contexts.

                       <!-- I have been figure skating competitively for 15 years. Figure skating 
                        has always provided me with a community from when I was little to 
                        connect with and support me. Now, in college with the MIT Figure Skating
                        Club, the team has provided me with leadership experience, an opportunity to 
                        introduce more people to the world of figure skating and a connection with collegeiate 
                        competitive skaters.-->
